# year1coding
This repository contains coursework completed in my first year at university. This was my first exposure to programming. 

Each program here is written in Fortran 90. This was the language taught by the Physics department at University of Surrey in 2017. Professors gave various justifications for using this ancient language over something more useful to students, I will not go into them.

Please note that these programs are presented as submitted in 2017. They all compile but they are certainly not perfect, by any means. The purpose of these repository is to track my journey through the coding world, and these were my first steps.
